## Notes

* With background cooldown times, if the player is using a short-sword they should be able to attack multiple times in the span of the orc attacking once. The orc should do more damage per swing at the cost of less attacks.

* Short descriptions should show target armor. Players should be able to target enemies where they do not have armor OR where they have armor that is less effective versus player's weapon type.

* Having a few different variants on hit responses to the player will help keep the fighting more interesting.
