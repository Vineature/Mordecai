## Notes

* Clearly there will be a lot of programming in the background, but this should give a first rough draft of what the player should see while crafting.

* A whole Curiass should take a number of ingots, I used 2 here as an example but the exact number can change.

* I think that a repeat of the makearmor Curiass command should work, but we can use another command if need be like $ continuecraft or something?

* Other MUD's allow the players to customize the name of the armor people see. This is an option we have, but I kind of like trying to reflect the player's experience in the armor as well. We could let the players set their own short description like 'A gleaming, Silver Curiass' but when players examine the armor they see a description like 'This armor was crafted by an expert.' for example

* I think this format can be used for most every craft. Depending on the time buffer we use we can do other update prompts to let the player know it's still being worked on.
