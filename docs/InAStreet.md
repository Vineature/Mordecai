You move north. (Tim)

You are in a small neighborhood.

## Notes

* we don't want large things (ox carts, etc) to go to the small neighborhood, so that exit needs to have a volume limitation to only allow things of a certain size and smaller.

* Also the input n or north or go to north should all work as well

* Cooldown for move between rooms. Players can choose to walk, jog, or run. Players who run get exhausted but have a super short cooldown to leave the room?
