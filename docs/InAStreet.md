You are in a street.

$ look

You are in a wide street with houses to the south and a small neighborhood to the north.

$ go to the small neighborhood

You are in a small neighborhood.

## Notes

* we don't want large things (ox carts, etc) to go to the small neighborhood, so that exit needs to have a volume limitation to only allow things of a certain size and smaller.
